"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions. I'm pretty sure you'll be able to check some of the formal definitions on a book such as Quantum Chemistry by Levine, they come mostly from working the Hydrogen Atom but there's plenty of nuances on its treatment and **i would not recommend taking my analogy on word alone**.",Chemistry

"The long answer to your question would be that your terms need to be properly defined. The short answer is maybe.\n\nThere are two distinct types of empathy: cognitive empathy, which is similar to theory of mind, the ability to understand how others think and feel. The second is affective empathy, which is sharing the physical experience of somebody else’s emotions. So, if somebody is feeling nervous, somebody high in affective empathy would also feel nervous. These are distinct traits. However, being high in either doesn’t necessarily mean you’re compassionate. Somebody could have high cognitive empathy, and just not care how others feel, or can justify their reasons for hurting others, or are supported by cultural norms or beliefs. Somebody with affective empathy might be overcome by their emotions to the point that they’re not able to be compassionate because they’re overwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with compassion is that we are not equally compassionate to all people in all contexts. I recall something from Sapolsky’s ‘Behave’ about women who have stronger ‘in groups’ display more empathy among each other, but show equal fear and disdain of out groups. So those who are more empathetic to their friends, are also less empathetic to strangers. Should we call that person ‘high empathy’ or ‘low empathy’? Neither seems to fit and the label is meaningless without the understanding of the context.\n\nSo, the question is kind of unanswerable because its too general. Studies of human behaviour are only meaningful within the context of the study and can’t be easily extrapolated.\n\nIn common parlance, ‘empathy’ is just a pseudoscience term for being a nice person. But, what is ‘nice’ is culturally relative and dependant on who we’re meant to be ‘nice’ to.",Biology

"Alfred Binet's intelligence scale, a prototype for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, was developed with the sole purpose of identifying French children with developmental disabilities so that they could receive extra help in school. Binet's scale assigned children a mental age based on a comparison of their skills with those of ""normally functioning"" children. Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence. Notable American eugenicist, Henry H. Goddard, eager to catalog Americans along just such a scale, promptly ignored Binet's warnings, translated the tests into English, and pushed for their wide-spread use. \n\n[The Eugenic Origins of IQ Testing: Implications for Post-Atkins Litigation](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=law-review)",Biology
"The same set of nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) are common to all animals, as far I know. In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\n\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\n\n\> Does the body know the difference\n\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\n\n\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\n\nNope. Each individual cell largely is its own factory, responsible for grabbing what it needs from the bloodstream, and discarding what it doesn't via bloodstream. Excess amino acids get excreted via the kidneys.\n\n\> Any good books on the subject?\n\nI have a batchelor's in biochemistry, so I'm not deterred by the jargon, but learned almost nothing about nutrition in my school days. For those with a scientific background like yourself, I'd recommend academic textbooks, like [Modern nutrition in health and disease](https://1lib.us/book/3484357/f6767f). For those without a scientific background, I haven't encountered good overviews of basic metabolism. The best I've seen for general audiences are the books by Michael Greger, M.D. like *How Not to Die* and *How Not to Diet*. These won't offer much detail on how nutrients are absorbed and disposed of, but may be of use in dispelling common myths and learning to eat a healthier diet.",Biology

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

Those currents carry some of the small particles with it, which make the current visible. The changes in speed are neat.

"For a projectile to do damage it has to be accelerated quickly to a high velocity. The explosion that fires a bullet being one example. The only other way is to provide sufficient distance that a smaller force can act for longer to achieve that same goal. \n\n\nWith a punch, the body constrains the distance available and so high acceleration is needed. This is limited by how quickly the muscles can contract. The amount of excess tension in other muscles is also a retarding factor to that acceleration. \n\n\nA punch just using the arm will be quicker, but the more powerful punches need to engage the rest of the body, which again reduces speed.

"Yes, top research jobs usually go to PhD and ScDs.  AS degreed applicants are usually hired as technicians.  BS chemists are sort of caught in the middle.  Don't restrict your field of fire for those resumes.  Research labs are not the only place where chemists are hired.  Consider manufacturing plant positions.  Third shift if necessary to get your foot in the door.  Consider chemical sales jobs. Or technical writing jobs.  The second piece of advice I can offer is to highlight what skills, knowledge and interests and hobbies you have in addition to chemistry and data analysis.  It's pretty obvious that knowledge of a foreign language will vastly reduce the pool of competitors for positions in global chemical companies or those who want or need to deal internationally.  But not so obvious is that if you can play the violin, you will be irresistible to a lab where there is already a cellist and a pianist.  A chemist who plays golf will have an advantage in a company with a golf culture.  Third, use your computer skills.  Research companies and institutions and their employees and management for intelligence and places where your interests are a fit.  If you are a bowler, find organizations with a bowling team or league. Target or retarget nearby chemist employers.  Locate the bar nearest to the lab and frequent it at lunch time.  Or if your research turns up information that a manager is active in a civic organization, join up.  Remember to tell yourself as a chemist, you are a problem solver.  If one approach to a synthesis is not fruitful, you would try another, then another, right?  Use the same approach for your job hunt.",Chemistry
But these are not theories. These are *hypotheses.* Experimentation needs to be done to test a hypothesis for it to become a theory.

I’m in high energy and have found myself taking more and more courses in electronics, circuit design, and EE to get a better handle on the detectors I’m working with. My friend in soft matter spends all day in the lab fabricating micro-robots and basically lives in the engineering department. I’m not entirely sure about cosmo, but you may find yourself on projects that depend heavily on using physics for analysis and then an engineering mindset for detector/scope development. \n\nIn any case, I say choose physics - the skillset you’ll build will work for many more careers thank you think, and you’ll still get to be an engineer in some sense.",Physics

If you're confident you have extremely high purity salt to begin with (KCl for example), you would need a very precise mass of salt and a very accurate volume/mass of 18.2 MO water (pretty common in echem labs).\n\nIt's all about how confident you are about the [Cl-] in your solution. Also about how confident you are that there isn't anything else in solution that behaves like Cl- (IIRC F- can interfere with chloride ISEs, don't quote me on that though).\n\nSo ultimately, if you can make it yourself and are confident in the purity of KCl / DI water you're using, I don't see why not. Bear in mind you'll probably have to re-make the standard (the shelf life won't be great) between experiments depending on usage.\n\nDefinitely calculate and propagate the error if you serial dilute to make a calibration curve.\n\nIMO it depends on whether you need the certifications that come with buying the standards / what kind of experiment you want to perform.",Chemistry

"Hey man, second year Uni student here.

Usually, the only people who get high-paying jobs right out of their undergrad are Engineers and CompSci/Tech students. If Chemistry is your passion, ride the wave.

"I think the emergent property argument, at least as I’ve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology
"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major.

My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

It’s kind of like I feel an invisible force pulling me to the right\n\nEven more interestingly, i could tilt my body left first, while still holding the handlebar to balance, then lift my hands off and the bicycle will continue to cycle straight perfectly balanced. If i start off perfectly balanced and lift my hands off then the bicycle will start tilting to the right which after a set amount of tilt, I will start responding and leaning my body to the left to counter the tilt\n\nConsider this similar observation I made as well, when cycling without hands, if strong wind comes at me at 90 degrees from my right to left, my bike starts tilting right against the wind. These are all too counterintuitive for me to understand what is going on",Physics

"The tertiary structure if a protein is due to the interactions of those side chains of the amino acids that make the proteins up themselves i.e. a side chain with “like” charges are going to repel while opposite charges can form an ionic bond through the transferring of electrons\n\nMore specifically, amino acids with polar side groups are hydrophilic (water-loving) and tend to be on the surface of the protein through it’s interaction with water making it soluble in aqueous solutions. In contrast, amino acids with non-polar side groups are hydrophobic (water hating) and aggregate in the core of the protein itself.\n\nHope this helps :))) Im a high school bio teacher and have my masters in bio 🥼",Biology

"Theorists are idiots, experimentalists are idiots. Anyone who isn't an idiot doesn't understand physics, haha.\n\nA slightly more robust statement is that the fact that neutrinos oscillate guarantees that there are new particles. And in nearly every model that I have seen right handed neutrinos are among them.\n\nI'm also curious about which experiments you'd shuffle around. I've written and am writing various reviews on the topic, so if there's something I've missed or if there is some subtle historical fact I have overlooked I would very much like to hear it. I know some people sometimes mention IMB for atmospheric since they did have the data before SK, but they didn't interpret it correctly, most likely because they were afraid of claiming a mixing angle ~45deg. I also didn't include Double Chooz since they don't really get the frequency, although I could have pointed out that DB, RENO, and DC all agree on theta13.\n\nAs for what other particles might be included, there are lots of options. Higgs triplets and Majorons are fairly common.

">The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all.\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.   \n\nWhether any and all of this is done by burning fossil fuels (to generate the problem) and running renewably powered CO2-harvesters (to fix it) such as the prototype in Iceland, OR by decomposing plant and animal matter over thousands of years (the problem) and growing plants and algae (the fix) -- regardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \n\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the ""sadly"" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.  As of now, you've written walls, I've said things, but we haven't been even discussing the same thing really.  \n\n\nI will read the rest of your comment, too :)",Physics

"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer. Maybe your super man will be as swole as a gorilla, but he's going to look like a Hapsburg.",Biology

"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century.

This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I’m no expert but I’ll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry

"Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.  Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question.",Biology

The technical part of your degree will make you a very interesting candidate .Chemistry in the US especially is an oversaturated field, even for PhD and Master students. I can’t imagine how tough it is at the BS level. \n\nThe roughest part is, with a BS career advancement at the bench \n/in the lab will be extremely limited and you will be far less compensated than a generic “business administration” graduate.

I did the same thing and got a graduate degree for further measure and unless you are from a top 10 grad school getting anywhere to give you the time of day is an absolute nightmare. I’m finally making the switch out of the lab myself to a science-adjacent field and couldn’t be happier.\n\nAs people have said “maybe” it is your resume and maybe that’s a component, but it’s more than likely you’re just encountering trying to get into a supersaturated field.",Chemistry

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management.

"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

"Not possible, and getting close is incredibly super niche, as in maybe <5 people in the world.\n\nMost neuroscience researchers will be MD qualified, or psychologists.  They just don't need the skills of a chemist for neuroscience or neurochemical studies.\n\nThe chemicals they do put in the brain they simply just purchase from the synthetic chemistry folk.  There are maybe 3 groups that have a synthetic chemist on staff, but those people aren't making new molecules - they are making familiar molecules on demand such as radio-labelled tracer molecules.\n\nYour niche with chemistry would be acting as a shopfront for the neuroscientists.\n\nOne possible niche is related to what I do - making materials to act as brain implants.  It's really difficult to find chemicals/materials that survice in the human body and still do what you intend.  Even more difficult to find any material that survives while acting as a tube to the outside world.  Medical devices and sensors are a trendy research area right now.  For instance, the Cochlear ear implant has a lot of different materials.  All of those needed to be designed, tested, modified over time.

"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"There’s an interesting neutron lifetime “puzzle”, where different types of experiments measure different values for the lifetime. Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn’t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons. This all happens under a shield stack of concrete and steel.",Physics

"> Can you slow down the decay?\n\nNo. (If you make a neutron move really fast then it may *appear* to have a longer decay time, but that's just a perspective issue.)\n\n> And can you measure the decay of longer-lived neutrons with your method? Wouldn't it alter the results?\n\nWe can measure them, but it doesn't alter the result. Beta decay is a stochastic event. How long a neutron has existed in the past does not effect the probability that a neutron decays in the future. A free neutron that has existed for an hour has the exact same probability to undergo decay as a free neutron that has existed for a second. However, most free neutrons will never make it to that one hour mark before decaying.",Physics

"I‘m sure that there are other good approaches to this, but this is what I would recommend.\n\nIf by „pretty much nothing“ you really mean nothing I would say start what at an atom is and how it is built. Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‘re interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‘s something you like.",Chemistry

It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.

"I'm having a hard time following the thread here. I suspension is basically a liquid that contains small particles of a substance ""in suspension."" A suspension is rarely the preferred formulation, but if the drug is not freely soluble in the liquid vehicle (preferred), then a suspension is the second choice. Nebulized corticosteroids are formulated like this because of their highly lipophilic nature.\n\nRegarding your second, recent question, I'm specifically avoiding saying yes or no because your question doesn't really describe what's happening in the body. The excipients are needed to create a delivery system for the drug, what happens when these tiny aggregates of drug/excipient/vehicle enter the body can vary according to the agents used, but yes, in most cases, a ""vitamin"" must separate from the excipients to become biologically active.

"If you want better answers you need to ask better questions.  Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

With respect to the mRNA vaccines the concept is not new, the delivery system was as I understand it the thing that made the vaccine viable where others have failed.",Biology

The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

I just think we have such an incomplete picture of everything it’s really quite a stretch to assume our mathematics and science understands the way of the universe to the point that we can even start to fathom the true nature of reality in the way we live day to day never mind atoms and sub-atomic particles. \n\nOur math is great to quantify and measure reality as we perceive it but it’s obviously a completely human construct meaning how could it possibly describe the universe (which is obviously completely non human in most ways) in human terms.

"Are you asking about the structure activity relationship of chlorine? I am just a pharmacy student that studied medicinal chemistry before so I’m not sure if you could trust my knowledge but as far as I know regarding the SAR of H3 antagonists, having a halogenated phenyl group increases the lipophilicity of the drug. Chlorine is a halogen and since it is attached to benzene then I guess it is considered a halogenated phenyl group? \n\nI tried to check different textbooks and researched regarding the SAR of H3 antagonists but I couldn’t find any regarding the halogen sadly, it doesn’t seem to be touched on much. But if we look at the organic chemistry side, halogens in general (chlorine) increases the lipophilicity of drugs. Also, chlorobenzene is an aryl halide so the intermolecular forces of it is Van Der Waals or London Dispersion, which makes it nonpolar or lipophilic. Since it is lipophilic, then it means that it makes the compound less soluble in water.",Chemistry

">I don't know that we have an urgent need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt is for something I plan to work on, but life outside of Earth is 100% fact, we cant argue against that.\n\n>It's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated.",Biology

"1)  You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\n\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\n\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections.",Biology

"I can't remember what I was watching, probably something on youtube, but they talked about the generic cost breakdown and building schedule of say a nuclear power plant vs something much cheaper and more plentiful like a natural gas power plant.\n\nThe breakdown was while a nuclear produces more power and had something of a lower overhead cost, the nuclear power plant took something like 6 years to start and end construction whereas natural gas was 2 i think. And on top of that nuclear took a couple more years after finish to start paying back the cost of the loan, while natural made consistent payments on a much quicker timeline.\n\nLastly is the short sightedness of politics. Investing in long term solutions can have negative impacts on someone's public view if it looks like nothing is happening. And in the case of elections where it may take longer to build a nuclear power plant than a single term, the pros may not outweigh the cons.\n\nI'm psyched about the next gen power plants though, there was this bill gates interview 3 episode dealio on Netflix with Bill gates talking about this team designing state of the art nuclear powerplants running off the byproduct of enriching uranium.

So, to answer ""people can well breast milk for a high price for a short time after getting vaccinated and advertise it as having antibodies?"", sure, they could, but whether or not it's entirely accurate or safe without proper testing, remains to be seen. That's a whole other rabbit hole that I'd rather not comment on.\n\n2) No. For the long explanation, newborns have special receptors on their intestinal lumen/lining that allow for the absorption of special nutrients, including antibodies, from the breast milk of the mother. These receptors allow for proper absorption and circulation of intact antibodies from the mother into the child. After a period of time with aging, these receptors go away in the adolescent/adult, so drinking breast milk from a recently vaccinated woman would not be beneficial in fighting COVID-19 in the adult patient.",Biology

"Ok so I'll just regurgitate what I know. Plasmogamy = Fusion of protoplasm/the plasma walls. Syngamy = Fusion of gametes. Karyogamy = Fusion of nuclei. In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\n\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions.

And even the standard clocks in different national laboratories are not in exactly the same gravitational potential. Therefore for realization of a practically useful time standard, such as [International Atomic Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time), the relativistic corrections are necessary.

"Like everything in chemistry,[ there are many different types of ""shock sensitivity""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_sensitivity) and at least 4 competing test methods.  \n\nFor instance, *shock* from a pressure wave, *impact* from striking with a hammer or *friction* of opening a container, sometimes you see static discharge included too.  These are different.\n\nThe oldest test is simply hit it with a hammer.  If the hammer is thrown into the ceiling, it's a shock sensitive material /joke.\n\nThe shock sensitivity of an impact detonation is called a ""gap test"".  Put a known mass of material in a metal cylinder.  Drop a heavy metal weight onto it.  Start at a low drop height, moving the weight higher and higher until the material detonates.  The smaller the gap, the more shock sensitive.\n\nPractically there is a low threshold point where you stop measuring.  There is no point determining which is baddest, it's all bad. \n\nBoth TATP and nitroglycerin have BAM friction score <5N and impact gap tests of ~5 cm (so very very low result = highly sensitive).

Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

Pretty much everyone has electricity available at home, even in pretty rural areas. There is almost no infrastructure for hydrogen anywhere.\n\nThat being said, hydrogen production may become more significant over the coming decades, but probably not for use in fuel cells.

Another example would be coyotes and red wolves, but anthropogenic habitat modification has caused overlap and hybridization.",Biology

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.  And it seems to me that idea extends to natural law as much as it extends to the ""content"" of nature (matter, and how the world/cosmos is arranged, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Cheers,",Physics

Every day life is about electrons, photons, up quarks, down quarks, and gluons. You could maybe make a case to include muons\n\n>The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.\n\nokay, sort of true, but really they didn't test neutrino oscillations, they tested the MiniBooNE low energy excess and disfavored that at solid significance.\n\n> This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.\n\nthis is just making things up.\n\n>That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. \n\nThis is highly misleading: this result does not rule out sterile neutrinos, nor does it rule 1 eV sterile neutrinos, rather it does not find evidence for the low energy excess that MiniBooNE saw which was often interpreted as evidence for a sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos could still exist at 1 eV but with smaller mixing with active neutrinos, or sterile neutrino could exist at any other mass range (likely heavier), or both. In fact, sterile neutrinos almost certainly exist somewhere, but they are very tricky to probe.\n\n>why the neutrino has such a tiny mass - which is what allows them to change flavour \n\nthe fact that their mass is tiny is not why they change flavor, rather the fact that they have different masses and that the weak interaction produces a combination of several different mass states.\n\n>its shadowy mirror-image anti-matter\n\nanti-matter is not shadowy; it interacts in essentially exactly the same way as regular matter.\n\n>That result was confirmed by a separate experiment tin 2002.\n\nthey can't even mention the experiment? The paragraph is ambiguous, but I assume from context that they are referring to SNO which measured solar neutrinos confirming the standard flavor-flipping (ugh, that sounds so stupid - why can't they call it oscillations?) not the LSND anomalous result.\n\n>They believed this form of the particle could explain the over-production of electron neutrinos and, crucially, give an insight into why the particles change flavour. \n\nA 1 eV sterile really doesn't explain why neutrinos oscillate in any particular way.\n\nThe article actually winds its way through the leptogenesis problem pretty well; implying a connection without out right saying it.

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set  \nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.  \nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point because first the peak starts decreasing and then it just remains...which is weird because I would expect the Thioester to be fully degraded) \n\n   \n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n  \n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? Also, I expect c to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (shown in d). They do have the same mass   \n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of **b** and **d**. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture, this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory   \n  \n**So:  1. why is there a deacetylation happening in the first place?**\n\n2. Is there maybe another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters?\n\n  \n  \nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to **a** except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an Amine *in this position* at all, so actually it would be counterintuitive that these byproducts happen because of an S-N Acylshift because there is no N close to the S in the other molecules). Still, they all show these weird masses.   \nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen?   \nCould the secondary Amine (the one next to the phenyl) participate in this reaction (because this secondary amine is also present in all of the three substrates)   \nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

You can see from this why you have to be going super fast to get any time dilation: small β means the denominator is about 1, meaning the whole Lorentz factor is about 1. In the example above, the time on the ship t' would be about 1.000000056 times the time on the ground (so they are virtually identical) .  \n  \nThings start to pick up the fast you go though. If you were going at 99% the speed of light (β=.99), then you can plug into the equation above and find γ is about 7. You could see this from two perspectives: in the frame of the spaceship, the earth time is passing seven times as fast; or in the frame of the earth, the time on the spaceship is passing seven times as slow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in your example: if 2.5 million years have passed in the frame of the earth, then a person in a spaceship going at 99% the speed of light would perceive that time as being about 357,000 years instead.",Physics

"Neutrons decay by emitting a Beta particle (electron) and a neutrino and end up as a proton (there’s a bit more that happens under the hood with quarks, but from the outside looking in this is the end product).  As a free particle, a neutron has more energy than a proton, electron, and neutrino combined.  This means that the neutron will tend to go to a lower energy state by changing into a proton.\n\nIn a nucleus, a neutron has the same potential energy as before, but now there are other positive particles nearby - protons.  To turn into a proton while surrounded by protons requires energy: the same energy as bringing a proton to the nucleus from infinitely far.  In stable nuclei, this requires more energy than would be released by the neutron during decay.  Therefore the event is exceptionally rare or practically never happens.  It’s as if the surrounding protons are gatekeeping the neutron and not allowing it to decay.\n\nIn some larger nuclei, where there are a lot of neutrons relative to protons, there aren’t as many protons to repel the potential new proton and more surrounding neutrons with favorable binding energy through the strong nuclear force.  These nuclei do have neutrons decay into protons through beta decay.",Physics

"No, or at least not with such a setup. In general relativity measuring the time difference is equivalent to measuring the local gravitational acceleration. They measured that with an uncertainty of 10% or so, figure 4 in the paper. A high school experiment with a pendulum can measure the local gravitational acceleration more precisely. A good gravimeter will measure the local gravitational acceleration with a relative uncertainty below 10^(-10).\n\nNone of these give a good measurement for G because we don't know the mass of Earth precisely enough (our best estimate comes from using G to calculate the mass, so you can't do the reverse). To measure big G you need to measure the force between two (known) masses in the lab. The time dilation from that is far too small.",Physics

Plus it was short, only five courses then on the research.  Things really opened up though once I got into independent research.

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations.

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire).

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

"Space doesn't literally curve like a trampoline with a bowling ball on it. We call it ""curvature"" because it's the closest real-world analogy to the way distances and angles no longer add up the way they would in flat Euclidean space.\n\nFor example, if I told you I had a triangle whose angles added up to 200&deg; instead of 180&deg;, the only way this could happen in the real world is if the triangle is curved. Lines on it would only be straight in the sense that they follow the surface of the triangle - anyone looking from outside would see that they were not straight because the surface is curved.\n\nBut this doesn't really translate when talking about space.

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

CO2 really does re-emit the photon.

Here's another [source](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/). Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes. Madelung's solid state physics book, for example calculates the rate of IR absorption, and you can calculate emission in an analogous way.

"Caramelization is accelerated at both high and low pH. However, caramelization is a large class of chemical reactions and the pH will change which products are formed. The main type of reaction is dehydration.\n\nAt high pH, you will see more polymerization of the sugars, forming large, conjugated molecules that absorb light giving you more browning. At low pH, you will see more small-molecule dehydration products like furans that contribute more to flavor but browning will be slower. \n\nAs for bread browning and flavor, both caramelization and the Maillard reaction will occur. The Maillard reaction is significantly inhibited at low pH. It involves the reaction of amino acids and reducing sugars. At low pH, the amino acids are protonated and become poor nucleophiles, so the Maillard reaction is slowed. It will still occur, however, and lead to different products just like caramelization.\n\nLow pH Maillard products generally have more meaty aromas while high-pH Maillard products generally have more roasty and nutty aromas.",Chemistry

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled.

So the premise of your question is already wrong.  \n\nOpen questions exist within the incredibly technical details when formulating a quantum field theory for gravity. But there is zero reason to speculate on a completely different ""mechanism"" for gravity based on pure guessing, thats just not how science works.\n\nOne remark on your idea, trying to relate gravity to magnetism just makes no sense. Even before Einstein, gravity in Newtonian physics and magnetism are just way to different: The gravitational field has monopoles, the magnetic field cannot have monopoles, only at least dipoles (every magnetic source ever has a north and a south pole, while there is only one gravitational charge aka mass). A gravitational field applies work on a test charge, a magnetic field doesn't. There are many other similar discrepancies, and these are only the most basic ones that everyone learns in their first year at university.\n\nAs a remark, I realize that all this may come of as a bit condescending, and it is good that you are interested in this stuff and try to think it through yourself. But the truth is, you won't solve any problems or even get the right ideas by guessing based on half-truths and half-knowledge. The only way is to have a deep foundation of both the mathematical theory and the supporting experimental evidence of the status quo, and then maybe inspire new ideas with a bit of intuition and guess work, combined with formulating it in a mathematical way, and thinking of testing the idea.",Physics

"""Why"" is kind of a trap when talking about evolutionary biology. Things gain and lose not just based on what sees them through to reproduce, but also for no reason at all. Why did humans develop different colored irises?

I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.

"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter.

In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

Cold neutrons travel around 2200 m/s, or roughly 7e-6 c (c is the speed of light). Ultracold neutrons are much slower, so we can approximate them as stationary.\n\nAt 7e-6 c time dilation is a 2.5e-11 effect, which is **much** smaller than the 1e-2 effect that we are trying to understand. Anything other than time dilation wouldn't work as an explanation.

"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"There are 4 effects at play here.\n\nNote, most times mixing a strong base and vinegar most times achieves nothing other than making fizzy water.\n\nFirst: a process called ""salting out"".  Add a pinch of ordinary table salt to acrylic paints and it will destabilize, separate and you get a clear layer of water on top of thick sludge.  Analogy is you have a stable positive magnet floating and then you toss a whole bunch of negative magnets to make it crash.  Most polymers are stable only at certain controlled ionic balances.  Some stains work by sticking really tightly to the surface of a material, almost like a magnet or velcro.  Stain()+ <---> (-)fibre.   Blood, some paints, protein and a few others.  Adding a whole bunch of salt overwhelms any ionic interactions and disrupts the intermolecular interactions bonds so you end up with stain.Cl and fibre.Na.  The stain material just falls off.\n\nSecond: Vinegar that has been neutralized or in the acetate form is very good at ""chelating"" calcium compounds.  Your acrylic paint probably contains about 20% calcite (chalk) as a filler.  By using the acetate ion you remove the calcite, which loosens all the paint.\n\nThird: pH effects.  The acrylic latex usually contains a lot of acid functional groups from acrylic acid polymers.  When you add ammonia it can make the polymer soften.  Tough to explain the chemical theory, but acrylic polymers change hardness (glass transition) by a lot depending if they are at high or low pH (ionic or neutral acid form).  As the ammonia evaporates your solution pH will also drop.  By swapping pH you are doing the chemical equivalent of pushing it backwards and forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForth: salt is a mild abrasive.  You effectively sand papered off the top layer of your clothing.  This is basis for the product Barkeepers Friend or Jiff.  Magic eraser would have the same effect.",Chemistry

"Biology is a very broad field. Introductory classes at university are typically vast and superficial in terms of the content. Specializing in a particular area of biology will  happen as you advance in your degree, taking more elective classes and focusing on your interests. Granted, this is how things usually work in the U.S., and I'm not sure where you are. \n\nIn the US, biologists with a bachelors degree work introductory level jobs in their field.  Many work as laboratory technicians or in other areas depending on their specialty. Advanced degrees (Masters, Doctorate) or certificates are required for more focused jobs with better pay. The coursework required to become proficient in these fields tends to be rigorous and require a lot of studying and focus. The jobs themselves have a range of salary and expectations - it's too broad of a field to get more specific than that. \n\nMajoring in biology is becoming a bit more rare as the life science field is more diverse than in previous decades. Many colleges offer different majors to accommodate this and allow students to focus on their interests and the required requisite knowledge, and become better prepared for employment in their field. If you're more interested in genetics or the body, I suggest looking into majoring in genetics or taking advanced electives in that field. Anatomy & physiology or immunology may be interesting to you as well. These courses are usually only available to those who have done well in the introductory courses that you are likely taking right now. If your university has guidance counselors that help with scheduling, it may be worth having a meeting with them. Your university might also have statistics regarding where their graduates with biology degrees go next - medical school, graduate school, employment in industry, academia, etc.",Biology

"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.  Or you can imagine choosing the most efficient route for a package in a large shipping company, with all of it's ever moving planes, trains, trucks, personnel, etc.  The variables are constantly changing, therefore, the package's route is ever changing.\nThis would be different, however, than someone who memorized fixed mathematical rules to solve a complex linear or singular type equation.  Therefore, if a multi-faceted intelligence is valued over a more focused linear type intelligence, then yes, it would require more intelligence to produce higher quality empathetic understandings.

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone 🎃",Physics

For example these can increase body temperature, increase mucous production, constrict airways etc all the common illness symptoms.

The rope is pulled down by its own weight, but is trying to be blown horizontal by the air resistance. At the top of the rope, there is more weight from the rope below pulling down, so the air resistance is less able to blow it sideways and the rope hangs straight-er down. Nearer the bottom there is less weight pulling down on the rope, so the air resistance can blow the rope horizontally more easily.",Physics

"It really depends on the laws of your country. In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your ""science project"", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously).

"Second year student here! Im currently majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics. I didnt choose biology simply because i wasnt interested in the subject as much as chemistry (still might end up taking one biochemcoyrse tho...idk) and because the career fields im interested in don't really require too much of a biology background (analytical, astrochem, organic, food, etc). Make sure to look at any four/five year plans the school has available for both majors so you can get a feel of the classes youll be taking for each and decide which ones you'll be able to tolerate or not. And, I think someone said it already, but in the first like year or two the classes for each major are pretty similar so changing majors in this time frame wouldnt be too bad.

The secondary stationary cart (cart 2) has zero initial KE. After an elastic collision, where KE is conserved, all that energy that cart 1 had is now shared between cart 1 and cart 2.

As far as I'm aware, no one has ever made this ester compound I was working with. However, I know that many esters react with aqueous hydroxide ions to make carboxylic acids (technically the carboxylate ion). I stirred my methyl ester around with some lithium hydroxide in water and a little methanol and got the product I wanted.\n\nConfirming what the product is depends on the compound.

"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics
"Notice that the mean velocity is **Vmean=(1/2)(Vi+Vf)**, so that from your formula **Δx = Vmean*t** (which is probably the formula that you know for a body moving with constant velocity).\n\nThis means that someone moving at a constant speed **Vmean**, will travel the same distance in the same period of time as someone accelerating from **Vi** to **Vf**.\n\nAnother way to prove this is: If a body moves with constant acceleration **a**, then its displacement is given by **Δx=Vi t + (1/2) a t^2**. The final velocity is given by **Vf=Vi+a t**. From this last equation, you get **a=(Vf-Vi)/t**. Replacing this into the displacement equation, you get **Δx= (1/2) (Vf+Vi) t**.",Physics

Lactobacilli, Pediococci, *Pectinatus* and *Megasphaera*) in filtered beer samples.""\n>*Pectinatus* [Pec.ti.na′tus. L. part. adj. *pectinatus* combed (bacteria)].\n\n>Cells are non-spore-forming, slightly curved to helical rods, 0·4–0·9×2–50 μm or more, with rounded ends and a Gram-negative cell wall. They occur singly, in pairs or rarely in short chains. Cells are usually motile by means of comb-like flagellation which emanates from only one side of a cell. Cadaverine or putrescine is found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Organisms are strictly anaerobic mesophiles with fermentative metabolism. Glucose and fructose are mainly metabolized to acetic and propionic acids. H2S and acetoin and occasionally minor amounts of succinic acid are produced. Cells do not synthesize cytochrome oxidase, desulfoviridin or indole, hydrolyse arginine or gelatin or reduce nitrate. The G+C content of the DNA is 38–41 mol%. The species of the genus can be separated from each other by using various genetic and phenotypic criteria. Isolated from beer and brewing processes.

"We’ll yes and no, a compound generally has to be polar to dissolve in a polar solvent like water because their dipoles will interact.\n\nBut asking why calcium chloride is soluble but the oxide is not is more complex as they are both ionic compounds so both are indeed polar. In the end it’s comes down to if the entropy of dissolution is positive or not, simply it has to be positive overall for it to dissolve. But the overall entropy is determined by factors such as the crystal lattice energy, the sphere of hydration and the disorder (entropy) of the solvated ions. so not the easiest calculations but it can be done.\n\nIn short the entropy change for the dissolution of calcium chloride would be positive do too the factors I mentioned but the entropy change for the dissolution calcium oxide would be negative and not allowed by the second law of thermodynamics so it stays in its crystalline form.",Chemistry

Adding on to the previous question, say joe were to close that distance halfway before the man compressed distance around him.

"As a chemistry the advice I always give in my office hours is to solve equation based problems in the reverse of how the solutions are shown in class.\n\nStart by figuring out what the question is asking for as the answer. Then start solving from an equation that has that value in it. (Early on in chemistry there will be only one or two equations that you know with the target variable, so it's a safe starting point) \n\nNext go stepwise through that equation and for each variable see if it's given to you directly by the problem. \n\nFor the remaining variables not given directly in the problem, find another equation that has that variable in it, and substitute that into the original equation.\n\nthen repeat going step twice through that new addition equation identifying which variables are given to you in the problem. Repeat for all unknown variables. If you sub in an equation and pretty much everything in it is not given to the problem try a different equation.\n\nI recommend not putting any numbers in until the very end. Keep the whole thing as an alphabet soup. You'll get lots of partial credit that way even if you mess up. Then for the very last step, show each number that you sub in and solve for the value of the variable the problem is asking for.

"I can’t necessarily debunk it. I think it’s a bit hasty to dismiss all homosexual behavior though as a confused instinct or something. Surely we can never really know an animal’s motivation behind an instance of a specific behavior; maybe they are asserting dominance or maybe they’re experiencing same-sex desire—who can definitively say?\n\nAll in all, I find the arguments about homosexuality being natural or unnatural because of animal behavior to be unnecessary. Naturalness doesn’t necessarily mean something is good or bad. And anyway, why couldn’t it theoretically be “natural” for the human species and no other? I just think it’s all kind of a fruitless argument, kind of like how when people debate abortion they spend all this time going back and forth about when “life” begins.\n\nIn the end, for human homosexuality, I think all we need to know is that a significant portion of our population experiences same-sex desire at some point in their life, maybe their entire life. Whether it’s natural or genetic or “a choice” isn’t really important. What’s important, in my opinion, is who gets to decide what human behaviors are acceptable and to what end? \n\nPersonally I want to live in a world where human sexuality is only limited by the absence of consent and the age of the people involved. Maybe other people feel differently, that’s fine. But we should all be asking who benefits and who suffers from their particular agenda.

I did not work on that part, a lab partner did so ignore the light absorbance results, I just copied those down from them. Anyway, at the top of THAT table, it says CONCENTRATION of stock. There, the 0 says H2O only, as if it were a 0% concentration of the stock, meaning a 100% DILUTION.

If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years. If someday in the deep unexplored ocean some decendant of [*Anomalocaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaris) was found, it would be the coolest thing, but it wouldn't change current evolutionary theory.",Biology

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology

"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods.",Biology

"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3σ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5σ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3σ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics

Overall the oil looks mostly waxy (arrow), but there is just the tiny amount of acid (suction cup) at the end that is really sticky.\n\nThe acid end loves to stick to surfaces.  Really grabs hold and stays there.  It's difficult to mechanically rub it off.\n\nThe vinegar is an acid so it will react with the finger print food oil stains.

"Sorry if I was brief above, but you just told the wrong narrative. The contribution cancellation you describe may hold at any given loop-order in the perturbative expansion of the vacuum energy coming from QFT. The problem with gravity is that it’s non-renormalizable. If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you’d have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT’s vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close. Due to the mismatch, one has to rely on a fine tuning which then removes the ability to predict the vacuum energy.\n\nFinally, this all assumes that DE is a cosmological constant (cc), which isn’t actually required by the data.

Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up.

"It depends on the depth to which you want to dive. \n\nTo give the basic gestalt: \n\nLight enters through the air into your cornea, through the pupil and onto the retina surface of the eye. \n\nTwo types of receptors in retinal tissue, called rods and cones, sense the light and convert them into physiological electricity in the form of an action potential. \n\nThese action potentials travel through fibers that travel back to the brain via the optic nerve. \n\nDepending on the location within the eye orbit, the fibers have a different pathway to the brain. \n\nThe fibers located in the retina on the side of your nose cross over just after entering the skull, at the optic chiasm. \n\nThis allows the left side of your vision to be stored on the right side of your brain, and your right side vision to be on the left side of the brain.  (the brain has a thing for crossing over like this).\n\nFrom here, the fibers travel to the thalamus, which further divides them by where they originated in the retina. \n\nFrom the thalamus, the fibers travel to specific parts of the occipital cortex, depending on whether they originated in the superior part of retina, or the inferior part of the retina. \n\nThese fibers travel to distinct locations in the occipital cortex. \n\nThe brain processes these impulses and produces your perception of your surroundings. \n\nObviously, great amounts of time can be explaining the nuances of vision.",Biology

"To make it easier to see that the center ring is indeed an 18 electron system, pretend the benzene rings don't exist and assign electron counts to the atoms and charges in the central main ring then add them. eg. C and N are 1 each [as long as the Nitrogen is not connected to more than 2 atoms in a ring system other than the outward pointing R groups eg. in quinozolium the Nitrogen counts as 2 electrons] and every excess electron in the negatively charged ring is 1 each. There are 6 Nitrogens, 2 extra electrons and 10 Carbons which sums to 6 + 2 + 10 = 18.\n\nAnother way is to again, erase the benzene rings and draw the center ring without them attached. You'll end up with 7 double bonds and 2 amine like Nitrogens in one of the resonance structures that you can draw. Each double bond counts as 2 electrons and each amine like Nitrogen also counts as 2 which results in a total count of 7 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 18.\n\nWhile the benzene rings do interact and share electron density with the central ring, for most purposes they can be treated as separate ring systems.",Chemistry

The immune response consists of more than just inflammation (white blood cell recruitment, memory-cell generation) that takes a while to generate maximum protection (two weeks for full effect). My **guess** is taking ibuprofen for one out of fourteen days wouldn't make much difference. \n\nIf someone wants to correct me, and/or link to studies of vaccines and ibuprofen, please feel free.",Biology

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

They are usually going to be very cheap materials with no real life time.  Any one of these materials can react badly to one of your chemicals.  Brutally honest, they really aren't designed to last more than a single bottle or two.\n\nInvestigate hardware stores for pesticide/herbicide hand sprayers.\n\nThose hand and pump sprayers will have recommended uses that may include high pH, low pH, solvent, salt, etc.  They should also have labels that say NOT SUITABLE FOR ACID OR SOLVENTS.  Pick one that suits your needs and put a label on it.  Only use it for that chemical.\n\nFor instance, a brass nozzle will definitely survive some chemicals forever but 100% die within seconds for other chemicals.\n\nThe cheap hack for low-budget cleaners is to use the original packaging.  For instance buy a box of 24 Windex bottles instead of 1 big refill bottle.

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

"It’s hard to say because it depends on what type of plastic the bags were made of. Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‘moonshine’, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation. Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm (parts per million, less than the other ingredients) but napthalene is what they make mothballs out of, and people happily put them in clothes closets for decades. It’s not very volatile, but you can definitely smell it. If you’ve thrown it all away, that’s OK. If you have clothing that’s come into contact with it, or you can smell it on that clothing, just wash that clothing.

"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry.

The x-axis is the scale factor which is related to time; the right side is today, the left side was a long time ago. The y-axis is the fractional energy density. Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper. But in general we see that the universe used to be radiation dominated (teal), but radiation redshifts away very quickly and its energy density goes like a^-4 . Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 . So it was always there but when you realize the x-axis is logarithmic, it isn't surprising that each one turns on/off fairly suddenly.\n\nAs for the future, see LSST now VRO, their physics cases are outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366).

"Gravitational potential energy is approximated for short falls, such as a flight of deck stairs, as mgh, or mass times the acceleration of gravity times the height. In this case, 77.1 \* 9.8 \* the height of 5 stairs. This quantity is equal to the kinetic energy Johnny has gained by the time he reaches the bottom, which is equal to 1/2\*m\*v\^2. Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time. Therefore, a more drawn out or cushioned impact results in a smaller force.",Physics

My body was still travel in a straight line due to inertia. From the bike’s perspective my body’s center of gravity would no longer be centered on the seat and tires and would start to cause a torque which tilts the bicycle right. The tilt causes the handlebar to then straighten out which aligns the bike’s trajectory to my body’s and therefore the bicycle continues on forward. But what’s left behind is the tilt, still being uncorrected and so I have to counterbalance counterintuitively to my left on the same side as the added weight so the bike doesnt topple as it is travelling straight ahead",Physics

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

"Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\n\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics

Awesome! A blast from the past...,Physics
"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology
