"Theoretical/mathematical physicist. The salary, if you're lucky enough to have such a prestigious a job at a university doing that as a career, probably  somewhere between minimum wage and below what you could be making somewhere else with your degree, but not too far from what a cashier would make AFAIK, at least for the first decade or so after undergrad. Heavily depends on the country. Normally they're paid as university staff according to their range (PhD student, postdoc, lecturer, professor...). They have to publish papers or won't get to stay in the field, need results to keep getting hired by academia (ie. university) and I imagine they also need to show satisfactory progress during the year. Hope that cleared up your questions.",Physics

"The inverse relationship is the key: the less uncertainty in one variable, the higher the uncertainty in the other. \n\n  \nSo, the more accurate your time measures are, the less accurate your energy measures are.   \nAnd the more accurate the energy values you get, the more uncertain your time measurements are.\n\nThe interpretation you describe is more restrictive. You are assuming that the accuracy in energy depends on how long an experiment is. That's not necessarily true.",Physics

"Not ""free"" elections, but it's what is called a ""Lone Pair"" (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_pair)), which are valence electrons that are not part of a covalent bond in a molecule.\n\nThe ""alien face"" is essentially reminiscent of the spatial distribution of the lone pair, since these are [p-orbital electrons](https://www.chemtube3d.com/orbitals-p/) that do not undergo the [spx-hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_hybridisation) and do not contribute to covalent bonds.\n\nHowever such lone pairs CAN form bonds, for example the lone pairs in the oxygen of water, undergo [hydrogen-bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) with the hydrogens.",Chemistry

"Well the only way to ""remove/neytralize"" a compound is by changing it to something else.\n\nMetabolizing something is chemically changing it to something else just using natural biocuemical processes. You can hypothetically chemically modify it too but youll likely mess with the entire tissue its in. For example you could incinerate the hell out of the compound but everything around its messed up too. You could use acids to degrade it but those acids will mess with the around tissue too.\n\nYou could maaybe get some sort of high affinity compound specific to the said compound, bind that high affinity complementary compound to a magnetic nanoparticle and  diffuse that through something and then recollect the particles but if its a tissue those nanoparticles arent going to be able to spread as ubiquitously. If it was just a solution then sure but not something like muscle tissue. (Also recollecting nanoparticles through muscle tissue using a magnet woildnt likely work or would at least be very painful",Biology

"Also, this is why I think we are doing a disservice by not using calculus terms when discussing kinematics. The amount of calculus you need for kinematics is only the power rule for derivatives and integrals, which you can learn in a half hour. We are also using this big long explanation ""find the area under the curve"" when we could just say ""integral."" I think introducing the calculus terms would also make that first unit of calculus make more sense.",Physics

"to be honest I dont agree. Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good. People should rather learn when to use the respective personal protective equipment.",Chemistry

"This is bad and potentially dangerous information.\n\nConsuming food from a lead silicate container is probably OK if done very infrequently. Maybe. If the container is rinsed immediately beforehand. And if your nervous system has already developed. But if you do it consistently over a prolonged period of time  - no, it is not safe. It is very much unsafe. Especially if the contents have a low pH.\n\nThe mechanism of leaching is as follows:\n\n* Ionic exchange between the ionic species in solution and the glass modifiers. This is primarily between H^(+) and alkalis in the glass matrix, but Pb^(2+) is easily leachable too.\n* Hydrolysis of network formers (e.g. silica, germania, etc.). This is the main reason why wet glass feels ""slimy"" and slippery. The process frees cations because of charge balancing.\n* Dissolution of the hydrolized species from the surface layer into solution.",Chemistry
"Perhaps you could goose it a bit by giving them more light to absorb from the overhead lighting?

Einsteinium.,Chemistry
"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10µg or more total mass.",Chemistry

"60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate. There may be something systematic on your end that you're doing/not doing over your qualifications. A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria. If the general talent pool is applying with a master's or PhD, then you're probably not qualified for the role (not always the case, you can be overqualified too, some people don't want to hire a PhD when they could train a BSC to do the job for 5-10k less per year.\n\nEdit, sorry for formatting, mobile",Chemistry

With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.”\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

So, it may be not much of a deal to grow up to that size.\n\nAlso, cephalopods have a lean, jelly-like, low-calorie flesh which may indicate that they need less calories to grow into enormous animals compared to say, whales or sharks.\n\nFinally, the female giant squid may produce more than 5 kilograms of millimeter-sized eggs.

"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization.

The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do.

We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

If however there's another mechanism for it to decay through, e.g. dark matter, then the two values would differ in the way that they actually do with bottle-types consistently measuring shorter half-lives.",Physics

"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all.

"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others. It's much like that episode in friends when Phoebe let's a bee sting her. I hope that attempts to answer your question.",Biology

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

After age 30, it’s natural for testosterone levels to drop by about one percent each year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt does have an effect on how deep a voice an adolescent has.

"Maybe I am wrong but the fact that we have this ""explosive"" behaviour means that the force resisting the opening of the lid is indicative of something non-continuous, like surface tension as you say, or some clipping mechanism to keep the lid in place.\n\nIf it was just the weight of the lid, what i would expect would be for the pressure to slowly build, up to being big enough to slightly lift the lid. Then the lid would lift slightly, pressure would equalize and the process would restart.\n\nIf it's surface tension or a clipping mechanism, the pressure would build up to a level higher than what is needed to just lift the lid a bit. Then it would continue growing until it reached the threshold of the clipping mechanism, or surface tension breaks. At this point the resisting force would disappear altogether, and the build up pressure would lift the lid in a more explosive manner, as we see.",Physics

"There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

It's easy for me to tell you random ""mind blowing"" physics concepts, but to internalize and understand the results of physics overall on a deep mathematical level, and to grasp how all the macroscopic phenomena you experience in the universe emerge from a very narrow set of fundamental principles and symmetries, is what gets you deep into existential crisis territory.",Physics

"**[Hopper crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_crystal)** \n \n >A hopper crystal is a form of crystal, defined by its ""hoppered"" shape. The edges of hoppered crystals are fully developed, but the interior spaces are not filled in. This results in what appears to be a hollowed out step lattice formation, as if someone had removed interior sections of the individual crystals. In fact, the ""removed"" sections never filled in, because the crystal was growing so rapidly that there was not enough time (or material) to fill in the gaps.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",Chemistry

Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well. However, it doesn't say to what precision the calculation is, though presumably it's tight enough to resolve the miniscule redshift...so possibly this is amongst the most accurate tests?

Superconducting qubits and quantum dots can be driven very quickly, with entanglement taking nanoseconds.

Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.",Biology

Well water itself is made of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen and gases can dissolve in water as well. Look at soda drinks it has co2 in it. Water is full of it…..you could inhale water and get a tiny tiny tiny fraction of oxygen but you would not be able to keep up with the demand and water acts as an irritant in lungs because the structure isn’t suited to deal with getting oxygen from water. You can get water into lungs easy but not so much getting it out…and in order to take another breathe you need to get it out so you drown because you can’t keep up with the demand. You would need to breathe an ungodly amount of water per second to get enough oxygen and lungs just can’t do that.,Biology

"I thought about rockets as well but they just exert energy to exit a field unlike hydrogen which doesn’t need anything because it’s less dense than everything else so it floats to the top. So in my mind it looks like this, heavy gasses trapped in atmosphere by gravity then hydrogen escapes from the ground and is less dense than all the other gasses so it speed up to a max velocity (think of a ballon filled with air under water). Then once it meets the edge of where there is less to no other gasses in the atmosphere it has to just push against gravity now and right there it glides right into space with ease. So does hydrogen actually have a weight if it fights past our gravitational pull with ease and if so how much does gravity effect hydrogen and so that’s why I’m curious of it’s weight. In other words what is gravity’s downward force on hydrogen",Physics

I had a very similar problem in grad school. The issue turned out to be a problem in the regeneration line - the exhaust solenoid had an obstruction, and so it was always open. As a result oxygen could sneak in through the exhaust line and into the catalyst, but would only be able to get into the box and the sensors when air was circulating through the catalyst.

If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don’t look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.",Physics

"Keep in mind, also, that except for the dz2 orbital, all the other orbitals are linear combinations of the wavefunctions that are proper solutions of the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics.  It's just that when the m-sub-el quantum number is nonzero, the wavefunction includes an imaginary exponential as one part.  Because some folks are uncomfortable with imaginary numbers, chemists routinely use linear combinations that cancel out the imaginary parts to give functions that are real (i.e. contain no square-root-of-minus-one parts).",Chemistry

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what’s actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we’re not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket’s increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point.

If the rocket is going faster then the fuel can provide more energy.  When burned, the fuel exhaust has less energy coming from a rocket that is moving quickly than it would at rest (since you subtract the rocket’s velocity from the rest exhaust velocity to get the actual exhaust velocity).  When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\n\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).",Physics

"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the “Standard Model” of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an “effective” theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

"Yes, you are measuring things.  Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.

"> I agree in a sense, but the fact of the matter is that you can always generate a theory to explain any given phenomena.\n\nHave you tried?  This is certainly not true.  Any new theory needs to retain the verified predictions of the old one in addition to making further verifiable predictions.  That's not a simple thing to do by any means.\n\n> When looking for physics beyond the standard model there are literally thousands of papers published from theorists everyday that explain the phenomenon by adding dimensions and unmeasurable quantities to fit the data.\n\nliterally as in metaphorically?  Or are you just saying something that isn't true?\n\n> Good theories have good measurable predictions beyond the observed phenomena.\n\nHow do you know these predictions are good if they haven't yet been observed?",Physics

"1)  You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\n\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\n\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections.",Biology

With respect to the mRNA vaccines the concept is not new, the delivery system was as I understand it the thing that made the vaccine viable where others have failed.",Biology

"They branch out. Nutrient concentration isn’t fixed where roots would follow a gradient. They branch out and absorb what they can; as well as leaves. The gradient within the roots allow for uptake. \n\nEdit: at least in average\n\nThe roots absorb inorganic ions in the soil, I.e., draw nutrients toward the plant root. The rate of uptake depends on the concentration in the soil solution immediately adjacent to the root. The rate of nutrient uptake is independent of the rate of water uptake, but the concentrations of nutrients at root surfaces depend strongly on soil water content.",Biology

"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code. But I think it's a fun place to start.",Physics

To grow a large bismuth hopper like this, you want to hit a sweet spot of crystallization speed so that your crystal is hefty but still has that distinctive growth pattern.

"I am increasingly interested in the prospect of going after a PhD in Switzerland or Germany. For the record, I have a M.S. in chemistry and the idea of a shorter PhD sounds appealing to me, especially given that I just entered my 30s. I look at various places and wonder how hard it would be to make this happen. For the record, I am interested in Eth Zurich, schools in Germany and the UK, and am passionate about organic chemistry and multi-step synthesis. I have been in industry for a few years after obtaining my master's, however I have no publications, at least, the material may not be published for a few more years (my former advisor is slow to publish and has a record of taking 5 years after graduation to publish a work). I am curious if anyone has ever made that leap from the States to Europeans schools. I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment?

If we see a regular (not-anti) neutrino that is right chiral, it’s not likely that it’s just a different state of the electron/muon/tau neutrino - it’s likely to be something entirely new, corresponding to the higher mass state.\n\n(I’ll also say I do astrophysics, not purely particle physics, so someone can definitely add to anything I’ve put here)",Physics
